This CLI is designed to create a mock inventory for an imaginary store and uses data stored in a server and MySQL to update in real time. 
As a customer, you can use the command line to view products and "purchase" them.
As a manager, you can view products, check on inventory that is depleting, restock inventory, and add new items.
